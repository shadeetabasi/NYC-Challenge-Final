# Overview
* The datasets created and utilized for our analysis and visualizations took data on New York City (crime, public school rankings, tree health, proximity to and status of brownfield clean-up sites, socio-economic indicators like subway access for the disabled, subway proximity and walkability and the percentage of students qualifying for subsidized school meals, filtered by zipcode. After initial exploratory analysis and cleaning, we decided to move foward with a Linear Regression and Random Forest Machine Learning Models.

# Machine Learning - Random Forest Regression

<img align= "center" src="3d.png" width="400" height="300"/> | <img align= "center" src="randomforestregression.png" width="400" height="300"/> 

<section>
Initially, we had 6 datasets encompassing Real Estate Sales, Subway Station Data, Tree Health, Crime, School Rankings and Brownfield sites for 2020 in New York. We reviewed the categorical and numeric data we had within and saw endless possibilities for feature creation. From the dearth of available x variables, we decided to pursue a Random Forest Regression and train the data to predict sales price.
 
<br>
<br>
Random Forest is an algorithm characterized as being both a supervised learning algorithm and an ensemble method. Supervised learning is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data and predict outcomes accurately. As input data (features) is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights through a reinforcement learning process, which ensures that the model is fitted appropriately.

<br>
<br>
Random Forest can also be classified as an ensemble method because it uses multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone. The algorithm is comprised of an n number of decision trees which collectively predict an estimate of the expected outcome by way of voting. The goal of ensemble methods is to combine the predictions of several base estimators built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve generalizability. The Ensemble Method's accuracy is consequently enhanced by the collective wisdom of the many decision trees which helps prioritize features and reduce noise. 

<br>
<br>
At its foundation Random Forest is a collection of if/or conditionals that can be used to understand the important decision nodes and how they led to the final output (dependent variable). For each new input, each tree in the forest predicts a value for Y (output). The final value can be calculated by taking the average of all the values predicted by all the trees in forest.

# Random Forest Regression Model
  ## Prework
  *  Merge all dataframes outlined above, only keeping the binary encoded values to use as features (x variables)
  *  Assign X values from the Real Estate Final table for the model & cast all as int 
  *  Assign Y value (dependent variable) from the Real Estate Final table for the model (y = sold_price)
 
```
# Run test and training of the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X1, y1, random_state = 101)

# Run the Random Forest Regression and then fit it to the x and y training data
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators = 2000, max_depth = 150, random_state = 101)

# Use ``.ravel()'' method to convert dataframe to to 1 dimensional array to fit machine learning model
model.fit(X_train, y_train.values.ravel())

# Make a prediction 
y1_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Enusre that y1_pred is not in scientific notation
pd.set_option('display.float_format', lambda x: '%.3f' % x)

result_regression = X_test
result_regression['sold_price'] = y_test
result_regression['y1_pred'] = y1_pred.tolist()
result_regression.sample(5)

# Score the y test data vs the predicted data
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y1_pred)
r2
print('R-squared scores:', round(r2, 3))

```

## Machine Learning Analysis & Results
The Random Forest Regression was passed 48 features for our X (independent) variable such as bed/bath count and days on the market and the Sold Price for our y (dependent) variable. We felt that the number of features were appropriate given the size of the original datasets were larger. The n value we choose for the forest was 50 with a random state of 101 to which provided us with enough trees and shuffling to predict a high R2 score of ~84%.


# Transform
### General clean up
  * ``str.lower()`` to convert all strings to lowercase
  * Rename columns to eliminate spaces and capitalization
  * Drop irrelevant columns
   * ``df[df.columns.difference([])``
  * Merge duplicative column values with slightly different naming conventions with ``.replace({})`` 
  * Drop all rows where zipcode column contained NaN values
  ``df = df.dropna(subset=['zipcode'])``
  * Datatype Conversion
  ``df['column_name'] = df['column_name'].astype('')``
  * Use strip method combined with a slicer to ensure zipcodes were exactly five characters in length
   ``df['zipcode'] = df['zipcode'].str[:5]``
   

### NYC Brownfields Data Set
  * Use ``str.contains()`` method to remove all records that were outside New York City (original dataset was for NY State brownfield records)
  * Group status of the clean-up site using ``str.replace()`` method - data has different rating scale depending on funding of the clean up project so some descriptions could be merged.
  * Generate binary values using ``pd.get_dummies`` on health status:
     * Potential Threat
     * Completed - Maintenance Required - Continued Threat
     * Completed - Clean - No Further Action
     * Active - Significant Threat
     * Active - Mild Threat
 ```
 # Generate binary values using get_dummies for danger level
 dum_df1 = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=["danger_level"], prefix=["danger_level_is"] )
 ```

### NYC Crime Data Set
* Remove all complaint that were records before 2020
``df = df[df['Start_Date'].str.contains("2020", na=False)] ``
* Ensure that each complaint_id value was unique
``df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['complaint_id'])``
* Convert complaint_date to datetime
``df.complaint_date = pd.to_datetime(df.complaint_date, format='%m/%d/%Y')``
* Create a column to denote if the danger level is low or high
  ```
  # Create empty column
  df["danger_level"] = ""
  
  # Assign specific complaint descriptions as having a higher danger level based on the gravity of the crime
  df.loc[df["complaint_desc"] == 'sex crimes', "danger_level"] = 'high' 
  df.loc[df["complaint_desc"] == 'rape', "danger_level"] = 'high' 
  df.loc[df["complaint_desc"] == 'dangerous weapons', "danger_level"] = 'high' 
  df.loc[df["complaint_desc"] == 'felony sex crimes', "danger_level"] = 'high'
  df.loc[df["complaint_desc"] == 'burglary', "danger_level"] = 'high' 
  df.loc[df["complaint_desc"] == 'robbery', "danger_level"] = 'high' 
  df.loc[df["complaint_desc"] == 'arson', "danger_level"] = 'high' 
  
  # Fill all empty values in the newly created 'danger_level' column with NaNs and use fillna() to create high/low dichotomy 
  df['danger_level'] = df['danger_level'].replace('', np.nan, regex=True)
  df['danger_level'] = df['danger_level'].fillna('low')
  ```

* Generate binary values using ``pd.get_dummies`` on category of crime (violation, misdemeanor and felony) and on newly created feature - whether the crime is defined as violent and therefore the danger level is higher:

### NYC School Rankings (Elementary, Middle, High) Datasets
* Drop all rows where county is not the Bronx, Brooklyn, Richmond, Queens and/or New York County
 ```
 # Filter out any counties outside NYC 5 Boroughs
 elem['county'].value_counts()
 elem = elem[elem['county'].str.contains("Richmond County|New York|Brooklyn|Kings County|Queens|Bronx")]

 # Reclassify inaccurate column values by replacing School District assignment with county that district is located in
 elem.loc[elem['county'].str.contains('7|8|9|10|11|12'), 'county'] = 'Bronx County'
 elem.loc[elem['county'].str.contains('13|14|17|21|22|24|27'), 'county'] = 'Kings County'
 elem.loc[elem['county'].str.contains('3|4|5|6'), 'county'] = 'New York County'
 ```

* Create a new feature and corresponding classification for Generating Binary Values for School Rankings relative to the State rankings
  * ``Use pd.cut( )`` method to bin School Rankings into Top 25th, 50th Percentile, 75th Percentile and Bottom 25th Percentile
  * Use``pd.get_dummies`` on the newly created feature (binned school rankings)
* Create a new feature and corresponding classification for generating binary values on a schools free lunch recipient status
  * Within NYC 72% of students are eligible for discounted or free lunch
  * Use ``np.where`` method to create Boolean column - true denotes that at that school the percentage of those eligible for subsidized food is greater than 72%
    * True denotes greater that the  72% of students are eligible for free lunch
    ``elem['lunch_eligibity_high'] = np.where(elem['free_lunch_recipient'] > 72, True, False)``
  * Use``pd.get_dummies`` on the newly created feature showcasing if the school was above the city average in student eligibility of subsidized breakfast/lunch
   

### NYC Tree Dataset

* Strip out the month and day values to leave only the year the tree was planted
```
# Ensure date planted only reflects the year planted
df['year_planted'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(df['created_at']).year
```
* Add Categorical Encoding & Binary Values for the heath status of the tree - good, fair, poor, dead
```
# Convert type of columns to 'category'
df['health'] = df['health'].astype('category')

# Assign numerical values and store in another column
df['health_level'] = df['health'].cat.codes

# Create instance of OneHotEncoder
enc1 = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')

# Pass tree health category column (label encoded values of health_status)
enc_df1 = pd.DataFrame(enc1.fit_transform(df[['health_level']]).toarray())

# Merge with main df on key values
df = df.join(enc_df1)

# Rename columns that were added from encoder array
df[[0, 1, 2, 3]] = df[[0, 1, 2, 3]].astype(str)
df = df.rename(columns={0: 'health_level_dead', 1: 'health_level_fair', 2: 'health_level_good', 3: 'health_level_poor'}) 
```

### NYC Subway Stations Dataset

* Use``pd.get_dummies`` to generate binary values for whether the subway station is ADA-Accessiblle - Yes, No, Partially
* Ultimately, all datasets needed to share zipcode as a common column to later perform a groupby function. The dataset provided latitude and longitude values  however there was no zipcode field. The Geopy library was used to create an API to find all location descriptors, using the latitude longitude pairs.
  * Step 1: Establish a connection to APIs by setting up the geocoder. First import the geocoder you want to use, and initiate it.
  * Step 2: Use Rate limiter to add some delays in between the API requests.
  * Step 3: Create a function to retrieve information using the coordinates --> Output returns a dictionary
  * Step 4: Use ``.apply()`` with function to isolate only zipcode

```
# Import Libaries
from tqdm import tqdm
tqdm.pandas()
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="emailhere@gmail.com")
from geopy.extra.rate_limiter import RateLimiter

reverse = RateLimiter(geolocator.reverse, min_delay_seconds=.01)

df['location'] = df.progress_apply(lambda row: reverse((row['lat_field'], row['lon_field'])),axis=1)
     
def parse_zipcode(location):
    if location and location.raw.get('address') and location.raw['address'].get('postcode'):
        return location.raw['address']['postcode']
    else:
        return None
df['zipcode'] = df['location'].apply(parse_zipcode)

```

### NYC Real Estate Dataset

* To generate binary values for the bins created to represent ranges for days on market, OneHotEncoder cannot process string values directly without mapping them as integers so for the days on market feature, use``pd.get_dummies``. By default, pandas.get_dummies only converts string columns into one-hot representation, unless columns are specified.

* Based on our selection to use a Random Forest Regression, we knew we would ultimately need one comprehensive dataframe filled with x features (inputs) used to train the model. The front end was designed to have an input option for the count of bedrooms and bathrooms and the Y output would be an estimated price. That not only informed our decision to focus our preprocessing on those columns but also use this dataset as the starting point for the future merge of all binary encoded values.

* The original dataset for all 2020 Real Estate Transactions in NYC was comprised of 36,177 rows and 41 columns. After dropping all rows with NaN values for zipcode or sold price and also dropping any rows where sold price < 10,000 (rentals inputted in mistakenly as sales or all transfers?) there were 35,295 rows to train our model. An unanticipated bottleneck was the need to replace string values - ``df['bed'] = df['bed'].str.replace('Studio', '0')`` or ensure all housing units listed had a minimum of 1 bathroom ``df['bath'].values[df['bath'].values < 1] = 1`` in advance of converting the bed and bath to floats. The machine learning model would also need to recognize sold price and listd price values so all $ symbols and commas were removed before converting the datatype.

```
# Remove commas and dollar signs from sold price listed price and convert to float
df['sold_price'] = df['sold_price'].str.replace('$', '')
df['sold_price'] = df['sold_price'].str.replace(',', '')
df['sold_price'] = pd.to_numeric(df['sold_price'])
df['bed'] = df.bed.astype(float)
```

* Beyond using the original Real Estate Dataset and append other dataframes to it, we also wanted to expand our feature list within the dataframe and narrowed our focus to the the 'dom' column ('days on market') but immediately saw that there were hundreds of empty values for the days on market field. With the work of excel, any column that had both a listing date and sold date calculated and populated the difference in days within that column. Moving back into Jupyter Notebook, we prepared the days on market for binning and ultimately binary value encoding.

* After converting the days on market value to a float and adding in values where both sold and list date existed, we filled in all remaining blanks with the average days on market (105), created bins using IQR ranges and used ``pd.cut()`` to create a new feature that could then be split into binary values.

* Create a classification using IQR calculations for Days on Market
```
# Convert days on market column to floats
df['days_on_market'] = df['days_on_market'].str.replace(',', '') # Removes commas from any properties on the market for 1000+ days
df['days_on_market'] = pd.to_numeric(df['days_on_market'])

# Fill all blank values in DOM field with average days (105)
df['days_on_market'] = df['days_on_market'].replace(r'^\s*$', np.nan, regex=True)
df['days_on_market'] = df['days_on_market'].fillna('105')

# Calculate IQR for Days on Market 
Q1 = df['days_on_market'].quantile(0.25)
Q2 = df['days_on_market'].quantile(0.50)
Q3 = df['days_on_market'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
print(f'IQR for days on market: {IQR}')
    
# Find upper and lower bounds to help identify outliers for each regimen
lower_bound = Q1 - (1.5*IQR)
upper_bound = Q3 + (1.5*IQR)

outliers_excluded_df = df[(np.abs(st.zscore(df['days_on_market'])) < 3)]
max_days_without_outlier = outliers_excluded_df['days_on_market'].max()

# Create bins to hold values
ranges = [0, 55, 105, 188, 388, 3140]

# Label the bins
bin_names = ["<55", "55-105", "105-188", "188-388", "388-3140"]

# Add a bins column 
df["dom_ranges"] = pd.cut(df['days_on_market'], ranges, labels=bin_names)

```

### Determining Walkability - Real Estate & Subway Station Datasets
* The original subway dataset provided binary encoding for ada-accessibility from the original data. To create a more interesting feature, we added a walk-score for each housing record using ``sklearn.neighbors`` which implements the k-nearest neighbors vote and finds the shortest distance which required us to compare the latitude/longitude pairs for all 30,000+ housing records against 494 Real Estate stations to find the closest station and distance in miles.

* One data limitation that became apparent was that the Real Estate housing latitude/longitudes were rounded to the area's zipcode so the 'closest' train station and mileage associated was inacurrate. To keep the integrity of the data, rather than binning within 1/4 mile, 1/2 mile etc. ranges, we simply did an over 1 mile/under 1 mile and dropped any column referencing the 'closest' station.

```
# Challenge: Find the closest train station to each housing record

# Import dependencies
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import sklearn.neighbors

# Find the absolute value of each coordinate pair
def dist(lat1, long1, lat2, long2):
    return np.abs((lat1-lat2)+(long1-long2))

# Extract all lat values and save to variable
lat_column = housing.loc[:,'lat']
lats = lat_column.values


# Extract all long values and save to variable
long_column = housing.loc[:,'long']
longs = long_column.values

# Apply lambda function across each column and if 1 apply the function to the row
distances = stations.apply(
    lambda row: dist(lats, longs, row['lat_field'], row['lon_field']), 
    axis=1)

# Use idxmin to calculate the closest station name

def find_station(lat, long):
    distances = stations.apply(
        lambda row: dist(lat, long, row['lat_field'], row['lon_field']), 
        axis=1)
    return stations.loc[distances.idxmin(), 'station_name']
    
# Find the closest station name to each recorded sale
closest_station = housing.apply(
    lambda row: find_station(row['lat'], row['long']), 
    axis=1)

#### Find the distance between two lists of geographic coordinates - Use Haversine Distance
# Convert latitude and longitude to radians and add these columns to the dataframe using np.radians

# Add columns with radians for latitude and longitude
housing[['lat_radians_housing','long_radians_housing']] = (
    np.radians(housing.loc[:,['lat','long']])
)

stations[['lat_radians_stations','long_radians_stations']] = (
    np.radians(stations.loc[:,['lat_field','lon_field']])
)

# Add unique ID column
housing['uniqueid'] = np.arange(len(housing))

# Append to housing dataframe
housing['distance_miles'] = minValuesObj
housing

# Use np.where to create Bool column --> True denotes less than 1 mile from train (lat/long in housing is zipcode based)
housing['under_1_mile'] = np.where(housing['distance_miles'] <= 1, True, False)
housing.head()

```
